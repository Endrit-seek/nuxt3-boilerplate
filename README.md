# Nuxt 3 x ESLint x Prettier x TS Boilerplate

Welcome to the newest Nuxt 3 boilerplate, designed to provide an exceptional development experience for your projects. With a powerful combination of Nuxt 3, ESLint, Prettier, lint-staged, Husky, and TypeScript, you can jumpstart your web application development and ensure code quality from the very beginning.

## Features

- **Nuxt 3**: Leverage the latest version of Nuxt, a progressive Vue.js framework, to build modern and performant web applications.
- **ESLint Integration**: Carefully configured ESLint to enforce coding standards and unify the development experience across your team. Say goodbye to code inconsistency and hello to clean and error-free code.
- **Prettier Support**: Prettier is seamlessly integrated with ESLint, ensuring consistent code formatting. Your code will automatically be styled according to ESLint configurations on save.
- **lint-staged and Husky**: Implemented lint-staged and Husky to prevent code with styling errors from being committed. Before each commit, Husky will attempt to automatically fix any issues. If it fails, it will provide clear guidance on where errors need attention.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is thoughtfully integrated to work harmoniously with Prettier and ESLint, offering static typing and enhanced code quality.
- **Pre-defined Directory Structure**: Organized the directory structure for you, eliminating the need for manual setup. Get started quickly with a well-organized project layout.


## Getting Started

Use the repository **as a template** or clone it. Do not forget to use the *husky command (yarn prepare)*:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Endrit-seek/nuxt3-boilerplate.git
  cd nuxt3-boilerplate
  yarn install
  yarn prepare
  yarn dev
```

    
# Optimizations

This Nuxt 3 boilerplate is designed with a focus on optimization to enhance your development workflow and project performance. Here's why it's useful and what optimizations it brings to the table:

## Streamlined Development
- **Efficient Directory Structure**: Meticulously crafted the directory structure, eliminating the need for manual setup. This structure follows best practices, making it easy to organize and locate your project files.

- **Code Consistency**: ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript work seamlessly together to ensure that your code adheres to consistent coding standards. This results in improved readability and maintainability.

- **Git Hooks with Husky**: With Husky and pre-commit hooks, you can catch and fix styling errors before they make their way into your repository. This keeps your codebase clean and avoids time-consuming clean-up efforts later on.

## Performance Optimization
- **Nuxt 3 Power**: Leveraging the latest version of Nuxt 3, your web applications benefit from enhanced performance, faster server rendering, and efficient code splitting, resulting in faster load times.

- **TypeScript Integration**: TypeScript brings static typing to your project, reducing runtime errors and enhancing code reliability.

## Collaboration
- **Coding Standardization**: By enforcing coding standards through ESLint and Prettier, our boilerplate ensures that your team maintains a consistent coding style. This minimizes conflicts and makes collaboration smoother.
## Time Savings
- **Plug-and-Play Setup:** With this boilerplate, you can hit the ground running. The pre-configured tools and directory structure save you valuable development time, so you can focus on building features and functionality.

In summary, this Nuxt 3 boilerplate optimizes your development process by providing a well-organized structure, enforcing coding standards, and enhancing project performance. It's a time-saving, collaboration-friendly, and performance-boosting solution that empowers you to create outstanding web applications efficiently.
